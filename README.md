## Project Description
This Tableau Healthcare Dashboard is designed to provide a detailed analysis of various health metrics for a fictional healthcare dataset. The dashboard utilizes Tableau, a powerful data visualization tool, to offer insights into key metrics such as diabetic vs. non-diabetic status, blood pressure categories, BMI distribution, and health factors by age group.

## Features
### 1. Diabetic/Non-diabetic Distribution
- Representation of the proportion of diabetic vs. non-diabetic patients.
- Insights into the overall health distribution concerning diabetes.
### 2.Blood Pressure Categories
- Visualization of patients categorized by blood pressure levels (elevated, normal, high, low).
- Helps identify the prevalence of different blood pressure conditions.
### 3.Patient Distribution by Body Mass Index (BMI)
- Breakdown of patients into categories such as underweight, overweight, obese, and healthy weight.
- Provides a clear understanding of BMI distribution across the patient population.
### 4.Health Factors by Age Group
- Analysis of key health factors such as average BMI, glucose levels, insulin levels, and skin thickness by age group.
- Offers insights into how these health factors vary with age.
### 5.Diabetic Patients with High/Low Blood Pressure Breakdown
- Detailed breakdown of diabetic patients with high or low blood pressure.
- Enables targeted analysis of specific health conditions within the diabetic population.
